# **Minesweeper Game in C++**

Welcome to the **Minesweeper Game**, a classic grid-based game implemented in C++. This project demonstrates the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) with concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. Dive in and challenge yourself to uncover all cells without detonating the hidden mines!


## **Features**
- **Dynamic Board Size and Difficulty:**
  - Default board: 10x10 with 10 mines.
  - Customizable dimensions and mine count for varying difficulty.
- **Game Logic:**
  - Uncover cells to display the number of adjacent mines.
  - Automatically reveal empty cells and their neighbors.
- **User-Friendly Input Handling:**
  - Prevents invalid inputs and ensures smooth gameplay.
- **Game Over & Win Conditions:**
  - Lose if you uncover a mine.
  - Win by uncovering all non-mine cells.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **C++ Programming Language**
- Standard Libraries:
  - `<iostream>` for user interaction.
  - `<ctime>` and `<cstdlib>` for random mine placement.
  - `<limits>` for robust input validation.

## **How to Play**
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/minesweeper-cpp.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd minesweeper-cpp
   ```
3. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   g++ -o minesweeper minesweeper.cpp
   ```
4. Run the game:
   ```bash
   ./minesweeper
   ```
5. Follow the on-screen instructions:
   - Enter the **row** and **column** indices to reveal a cell.
   - Avoid mines and uncover all safe cells to win!

## **Gameplay Overview**
- At the start of the game, you can choose the default settings or customize the board size and mine count.
- Once the game begins, the board is displayed as a grid of `_` (unrevealed cells).
- Use the coordinates to reveal cells and avoid hidden mines.
- The game ends when:
  - You uncover all non-mine cells (Win).
  - You hit a mine (Lose).

## **Sample Output**
```
///////////////////////////////////////////

         Minesweeper Game!

///////////////////////////////////////////

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
0 | _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

Enter row and column (0-9): 3 4
```

## **Code Highlights**
- **Object-Oriented Design:**
  - `Game`: Abstract base class defining the game's blueprint.
  - `Minesweeper`: Derived class implementing the Minesweeper-specific logic.
- **Dynamic Memory Management:**
  - Arrays (`board` and `mines`) are dynamically allocated for flexible board sizing.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Ensures valid inputs for row, column, and mine count.
- **Recursive Cell Reveal:**
  - Automatically uncovers neighboring cells when a safe cell is revealed.

## **Future Enhancements**
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for an enhanced experience.
- Implement a timer and leaderboard to track player performance.
- Include save/load game functionality for continued gameplay.
